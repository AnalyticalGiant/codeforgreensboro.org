This is the marketing and information site for Code for Greensboro, the Code for America Brigade for the city of Greensboro, NC.

### About
Ruby on Rails is fast, easy to learn, and fits well with the project landscape of Code for America. This application should probably run without a model, or with a very minimal model for page content. We handle static pages with [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage), which allows us to keep Rails conventions like layouts and views but without the overhead of a dedicated Pages controller.

### Styling
- Uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) for CSS processing
- Uses [Bourbon](http://www.bourbon.io), [Neat](http://www.neat.io) and [Bitters](http://www.bitters.io) for mixins, grids, responsive presentation and to manage sane defaults
- Uses [Font Awesome](https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails) for quick icon goodness

### Serving static files
Since a lot of the site is static or mostly static pages, we're using [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) to make this easier.

The essential part of High Voltage is:

Write your static pages and put them in the RAILS_ROOT/app/views/pages directory.

	$ mkdir app/views/pages
	$ touch app/views/pages/about.html.erb

After putting something interesting there, you can link to it from anywhere in your app with:

	link_to 'About', page_path('about')

You can nest pages in a directory structure, if that makes sense from a URL perspective for you:

	link_to 'Q4 Reports', page_path('about/corporate/policies/HR/en_US/biz/sales/Quarter-Four')

Bam.
