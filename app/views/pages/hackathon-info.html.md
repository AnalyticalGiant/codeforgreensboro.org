##Trademark Scavenger Hunt  
**Partners:** US Patent and Trademark Office  
Hashtag: #USPTOPhotoHunt  

**Challenge info:**  
This challenge is to create a mobile photo scavenger hunt game to challenge your friends to find some of the registered trademarks all around us. The organizers will use registered trademark data provided by the USPTO to look up their favorite trademarks and compile a list of registered trademark images and bibliographic information about the trademark. They will then send their challenge list and time limit to their friends. The players will take pictures of those registered trademarked items and send them to the organizers. The winner will be the person that finds the most registered trademarks on the challenge list.

This game is intended as a fun way to increase awareness of trademarks in our everyday lives.  

**Data & Other Resources:**  
Trademark image and descriptive data can be accessed through the Trademark Official Gazette (TMOG), bulk data files, and through a limited application programming interface (API).  
- Trademark Official Gazette: The Trademark Official Gazette (TMOG) is a weekly publication containing bibliographic information and a representative drawing for each mark published shortly after it is approved for registration, along with a list of recently cancelled and renewed registrations. More information regarding TMOG can be found here: http://www.uspto.gov/news/og/trademark_og/index.jsp  
- Bulk download of Trademark data: The USPTO also makes Trademark Application Image information available through bulk download. More information about these products can be found here:

##Health Impacts of Climate Change  
**Partners:** NASA, NOAA  
Hashtag: #NASA, #NOAA, #climatechange  

**Challenge info:**  
Although the impacts of climate change have the potential to affect human health in the United States and around the world, there is a lot we can do to prepare for and adapt to these changes. We challenge you and your team to develop ways to turn this available data into useful and accessible information for citizens; to help them better adapt to and manage climate variability. Agencies like National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) have developed world-class science data to support scientific research in climate change. Using data provided NASA, NOAA, USGS and other government agencies, develop technology or visualizations that combine different climate-related datasets.  
**Areas of interest:**  
Areas of interest that may be particularly relevant to local cities could include:  
- Storm surge/coastal flooding: Develop solutions to predict, protect and restore coastlines, natural spaces and animal habitats due to flooding
- Drought prediction and management: Use of data around trees dying in local cities, geological data, precipitation/reservoir data and water data from PWE
- CO2 emission reduction: Help cities be able to measure C02 emission reduction consistently to allow for an apples to apples comparison across cities.  Visualize how much less CO2 emission has resulted from changing fleet of city owned cars
- Extreme weather: Respond to flooding, tropical storms, wildfires and extreme sudden weather events
- Efficiency: Build technology to help citizens and organizations better understand smart meter data
- Map deforestation in correlation with pollution data
- Map of land erosion versus water levels
- Fuel leak data vs. death of vegetation in the area
- Farming subsidy vs. CO2 from cattle vs. death of vegetation
- Trending of 100 year flood plains to see if it has gotten better worse and re classify the flood plains if necessary
- The effect of increase construction on water pollution
- Electricity usage year over year versus building footprint of city
- Increase use of port vs. ocean acidification
- Pesticide runoff vs. algae blooms

##Innovative Access to Scientific Reference Data  
**Partners:** National Institute of Standards & Technology  
Hashtag: #NISTDATA  

**Project Lead**: Ethan Stringfellow  

**Challenge info:**  
Forensic investigators, biochemical engineers, environmental researchers, and many other technically trained experts routinely use NIST Standard Reference Data to identify trace chemicals and to design new experiments and products such as pharmaceuticals. Students from high school through graduate school use the same datasets to master the ropes of scientific discovery.

With over 100 types of data available, however, finding exactly what you need quickly and easily can be challenging. NIST invites the civic hackathon community to develop innovative apps that aggregate and improve the usability of free NIST datasets and resources. There are no existing mobile or tablet applications designed for NIST scientific reference datasets. Help us put the power of data at experts’ fingertips even when they are in the lab or out in the field.

Scientists need data—from the atomic weight of carbon and the structure of benzene, to the most precise value for the speed of light. High quality physical and chemical reference data helps researchers design experiments, build better products, solve health and environmental problems, and even study the stars. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, provides some of the most accurate and comprehensive datasets in the world. Help NIST improve access to this critical information by creating new apps so that researchers can quickly find what they need, starting with the four Scientific Reference Data identified in the challenge description. Everyone from Nobel-prize-winning physicists to high school chemistry students will thank you!  

**Data & Other Resources:**  
For this challenge, NIST has identified four initial datasets pertaining to physics and chemistry data:  
- CODATA Fundamental Physical Constants: The fundamental physical constants have specific and universally-used symbols, including the velocity of light in vacuum (c), charge of the electron (e), and Planck’s constant (h). These constants are essential to basic theories of physics and our quantitative understanding of the physical universe. This resource provides the most accurate internationally recommended values of these constants available. (NIST SRD 121) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fundamental-physical-constants
- Ground Levels and Ionization Energies for the Neutral Atoms: This resource provides scientific values of ground levels and ionization energies for neutral atoms. (NIST SRD 111) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-ground-levels-and-ionization-energies-for-the-neutral-atoms-srd-111
- Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions: This compilation of data provides atomic weights for elements 1 through 118, noting isotopic compositions or abundances when appropriate. (NIST SRD 144) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-srd-144
- NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database (CCCBDB): The CCCBDB provides thermochemical data for a selected set of over 1,000 gas-phase atoms and molecules. It is used by chemists to compare experimental results with computational ideal-gas properties. (NIST SRD 101) https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-computational-chemistry-comparison-and-benchmark-database-srd-101
- Other: additional Free Online NIST Standard Reference Data can be found by searching the NIST Data Gateway http://srdata.nist.gov/gateway

###World Wide Schools Redesign  
**Partners:** Peace Corps  
Twitter: @PeaceCorps, @PCThirdGoal  

**Challenge info:**  
The current World Wise Schools website offers cross-cultural educational materials for K–12 students including literature, videos, and lesson plans. It also hosts two cross-cultural matching programs: 1) Speakers Match, which connects RPCVs with U.S. educators for in-person presentations 2) Correspondence Match, which connects PCVs overseas with U.S. classrooms, similar to a penpal exchange. As currently designed, the programs have technical limitations due to difficulty in determining a quality match, promotion of content generated, gauging participation, and difficulties with processing enrollments.  
- Our matching and enrollment processes are entirely manual for both Correspondence Match and Speakers Match, often requiring copy and pasting of data from an email.
Matches are performed by 3GL staff who must guess at a good match, with no way to monitor progress or activity of the match.
- In the current World Wise Schools program, there is little to no structure, which contributes to inactivity or ineffective communication/activities on the part of both Volunteers and RPCVs, and with educators and the general public.
- Volunteer access to Internet and connectivity speed varies greatly.
- There are currently more PCVs participating in WWS matching programs than educators or members of the general public.
- To accurately report on Peace Corps strategic goals, 3GL must measure the number of Volunteers who report they facilitated direct interactions between Americans and host country individuals and communities. It is very difficult to measure these interactions with the current system.
