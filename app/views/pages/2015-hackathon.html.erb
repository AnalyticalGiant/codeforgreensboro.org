		<h3>This summer, Greensboro will have its very first civic hackathon. And we want you to be there.</h3>

		<h5>
			What is this thing?
		</h5>

		<p>
			June 6, 2015 is the <%= link_to "National Day Of Civic Hacking", "http://hackforchange.org" %>, and we'll be celebrating with a hackathon. What can we do when we put all of Greensboro's most passionate developers, designers, data junkies, policy wonks, community organizers and engaged citizens in one place for a day? A lot, that's what. Join us as we identify civic problems, build solutions that use real data to solve those problems, and have an amazing time doing it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bring your laptop, an open mind, and your best ideas. We'll bring the data, a love for Greensboro and all it can be, and some pioneering spirit to share.
		</p>

		<p>
			This event is <em><%= link_to "huge", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/12/save-date-national-day-civic-hacking-coming-june-6" %></em>, and we're incredibly excited to take part. We'll be working together on some of the <%= link_to "challenges", "http://hackforchange.org/challenges/"%> outlined by Code for America, as well as independent projects&mdash;maybe even something you bring with you.
		</p>
